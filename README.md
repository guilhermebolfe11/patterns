# Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains a collection of design patterns implemented in various programming languages. The goal is to provide clear, practical examples and explanations for each pattern, making it easier to understand and apply them in real-world projects.

## What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices used by experienced developers to solve recurring design challenges.

## Categories of Patterns
- **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms.
  - [Factory Method](./CreationalPatterns/FactoryMethod/README.md)
  - [Abstract Factory](./CreationalPatterns/AbstractFactory/README.md)
  - [Builder](./CreationalPatterns/Builder/README.md)
  - [Prototype](./CreationalPatterns/Prototype/README.md)
  - [Singleton](./CreationalPatterns/Singleton/README.md)
- **Structural Patterns**: Focus on the composition of classes and objects.
  - [Adapter](./StructuralPatterns/Adapter/README.md)
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Concerned with object interaction and responsibility.

## Structure of the Repository
Each pattern will have:
- A brief description
- UML diagram (if applicable)
- Example implementation
- Usage example
- Pros and cons

## How to Use
1. Browse the folders for the pattern you are interested in.
2. Read the description and study the example code.
3. Run or adapt the code for your own projects.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests with new patterns, improvements, or examples in different languages.
